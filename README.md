# Data-analysis-Time-Series-of-Coastal-Oceanographic-Data-in-the-Southeastern-Indian-Ocean-Indonesia

Here is the detailed script for analysis data in paper "Time series of coastal oceanographic data in the southern indian ocean Indonesia".
We used R programming language to summarize and describe the features of the dataset. Additionally, we visualized each environmental variable to gain an initial understanding of the results. Then, we used dplyR, tidyR, ggplot2, and readxl package to process the data in R version (version 4.4.2).
